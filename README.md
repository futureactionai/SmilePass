# 😊 SmilePass - No-Code Smile Detection Plugin

*"Sometimes a smile is the most powerful medicine — it makes people notice."*

## 🎯 The Story

In a world where digital interactions often lack human warmth, **SmilePass** bridges the gap between technology and genuine human connection. This project was born from a simple observation: when people receive real-time feedback about their facial expressions, they naturally become more aware of their emotional state and tend to smile more.

**SmilePass** is a custom block plugin for **AugeLab Studio** - a no-code visual programming platform. Instead of writing complex computer vision code, you simply drag and drop the **SmileDetector** block to create powerful smile detection applications.

## 🚀 Why No-Code Matters?

- **⚡ From idea to prototype in minutes** - not hours of coding
- **🎯 Focus on the problem**, not the technical implementation  
- **🤝 Anyone can contribute** - designers, researchers, domain experts
- **🔧 Visual debugging** - see exactly how your detection pipeline works
- **📱 Instant deployment** - test with your webcam immediately

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time face and smile detection** using OpenCV Haar Cascades
- **Instant feedback**: Live "Smiling" / "Not Smiling" labels  
- **Multi-output system**: Face count, smile status (Boolean), and text labels
- **Lightweight architecture**: Runs on low-end hardware
- **No-code solution**: Pure visual block programming in AugeLab Studio

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **AugeLab Studio**: No-code visual programming platform
- **SmileDetector Block**: Custom plugin for drag-and-drop smile detection
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing engine
- **Haar Cascade Classifiers**: Face and smile detection algorithms
- **Python Backend**: Core detection logic (SmileDetector.py)
- **Real-time processing**: Optimized for live camera feeds

## 🔧 The SmileDetector Block

The heart of this project is the **SmileDetector** custom block for AugeLab Studio:

- **Drag & Drop**: Simply add the block to your visual workflow
- **Right-click customization**: Access designer window to modify block parameters
- **Visual debugging**: See detection results in real-time
- **Multiple outputs**: Connect face count, smile boolean, and status text to other blocks

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Uses `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` to identify faces
2. **Smile Analysis**: Applies `haarcascade_smile.xml` within detected face regions
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Instantly displays detection results
4. **Multiple Outputs**: Provides face count, smile boolean, and status labels

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **AugeLab Studio** installed on your system
- Webcam or camera device
- Windows OS (tested environment)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download Plugin Files**
   ```
   - haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
   - haarcascade_smile.xml  
   - SmilePass.pmod
   - SmileDetector.py
   ```

2. **Install SmileDetector Block**
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\AugeLab Studio\marketplace\custom_blocks`
   - Copy all downloaded files to this directory
   - Restart AugeLab Studio

3. **Open Sample Project**
   - Launch AugeLab Studio
   - Go to **File → Open**
   - Select `SmilePass.pmod`

4. **Customize Your Block**
   - Find the **SmileDetector** block in your workspace
   - **Right-click** on the block
   - Select **"Designer Window"** to modify parameters and code
   - Adjust detection settings as needed

5. **Connect and Run**
   - Connect camera input to SmileDetector block
   - Link outputs to display or logic blocks
   - Click run and start smiling! 😊

### Block Configuration

Access these parameters via **right-click → Designer Window**:

- `scaleFactor`: Detection sensitivity (default: 1.1)
- `minNeighbors`: Detection stability (default: 5)  
- `minSize`: Minimum face size for detection
- `cascade_path`: Path to Haar cascade files

## 🔧 Known Limitations & Future Development

### Current Limitations
- **Side-face detection**: Struggles when head is tilted or turned sideways
- **Partial occlusion**: Glasses, masks may reduce accuracy
- **Subtle smiles**: May be inconsistent with very subtle facial expressions
- **Distance sensitivity**: Performance decreases with very distant faces

### Roadmap for Improvement
- **CNN Integration**: Deep learning models for better accuracy
- **DLIB Support**: Enhanced facial landmark detection  
- **MediaPipe Implementation**: Real-time pose estimation
- **Multi-angle Detection**: 360-degree face recognition
- **Emotion Classification**: Beyond just smile/no-smile detection
